## Projects

### [Hash Function Demonstration](https://github.com/rae3skhan/Hash-Function)
This project showcases the practical application of hash functions to ensure the integrity of messages during transmission.

Project Overview
In this demonstration:

A sender generates a hash of their message and sends both the message and its hash to a receiver.
The receiver verifies the integrity of the message by comparing the received hash with a hash generated from the received message.
The project also features a "Man in the Middle" section to simulate an attacker altering the message, emphasizing the critical role of hash functions in detecting tampered data.
